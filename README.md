# Frequent Case Notes
## Email Receipt
The guest informed us that they were unable to locate their email receipt. In response, I promptly took steps to locate their order by requesting and using the [confirmation number: , phone number: , and CC Number (last 4): ] associated with the purchase. Additionally, I verified their identity by asking for details such as the total amount paid, order date, and specific items purchased. After successfully validating the guest's identity, I proceeded to send a copy of the receipt to the email address [xxxxx@xxx.com]. To ensure they receive it promptly, I also advised the guest to check their spam or junk email folder, as receipts can sometimes be filtered there automatically. I remained on the line for approximately half a minute to ensure the guest received the email and confirmed its reception.[Jose 82318]
## Cancellations, changes and refunds
The guest requested [Insert Request] for their booking. I promptly informed them about the venue's Terms of Use and Refund Policy, as stated in the ticket, which strictly prohibit cancellations, refunds, rainchecks, exchanges, and replacement of lost, stolen, or unused items. I explained that these requests are managed exclusively by the venue. To assist the guest further, I provided them with the Guest Relations phone number [xxx-xxx-xxxx], mentioning they can contact the park at their convenience. [Jose 82318]
